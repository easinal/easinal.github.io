## Project and Research Experience

**University of California, Riverside**  
*Research Assistant, Dec 2021 -- Present*

- **Parallel Contraction Hierarchies:** Proposed a parallel algorithm for constructing contraction hierarchies, one of the most widely used shortest path algorithms. Implemented the algorithm, achieving an average 10x speedup over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) parallel baseline while maintaining competitive query performance. To be appeared in ICS’25.  
  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ucrparlay/Parallel-Contraction-Hierarchy)
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18008)

- **Parallel Longest Increasing Subsequence:**  Developed a parallel algorithm for LIS with optimal work and non-trivial parallelism. Its implementation achieves a 2.5x speedup over the SOTA parallel baseline. Published in SPAA’23.  
  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ucrparlay/Parallel-LIS)
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09809)


- **Parallel Huffman Tree:** Studied and implemented the first publicly available parallel algorithm for constructing huffman tree using C++, achieving 10--20x speedups compared to the SOTA sequential baseline. Published in SPAA’22.
